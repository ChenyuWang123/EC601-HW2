# Explanation 

## The choose of the device.

My device pool includes:

Google Pixel 2 8.0.0

Huawei Nexus 6P 7.1.2

Huawei P9 6.0

LGE LG V20 (T-Mobile) 7.0

LGE LG V20 (Verizon) 7.0

Samsung Galaxy S6 (T-Mobile) 7.0

Samsung Galaxy S6 (Verizon) 5.0.2

Samsung Galaxy S7 (AT&T) 6.0.1

Samsung Galaxy S7 (T-Mobile) 6.0.1

Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F

I choose theses because I want to test different brands of the phone, differenr version of the andriod. Also, the exist of the Edge also is in my consideration.

## Pictures for the result.

There are several pictures in the file for description of the results of the test. The screenshots are the pictures for the errors during the test.

## Analysis of the result.

The application works well during most of the situations. The test of the google pixel 2 doesn't work because the source of the phone in AWS has some issues I think. The only error happened on the Huawei Nexus 6P. I think that is because that the version of the android system on that phone has been adjusted. So the application doesn't fit it very well.

Overall, the application passed the test and is reliable.
